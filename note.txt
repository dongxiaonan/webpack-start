Step One: 
create new file entry.js, index.html
run webpack to build entry.js to bundle.js

Step Two:
add new module content.js, update entry.js to let it depends content.js. 

run webpack to build entry.js and all dependencies into bundle.js

---------
webpack will analyze your entry file for dependencies to other files. These files (called modules) are included in your bundle.js too. webpack will give each module a unique id and save all modules accessible by id in the bundle.js file. Only the entry module is executed on startup. A small runtime provides the require function and executes the dependencies when required.

Step Three
add loader: webpack can only handle Jacascript natively, so if we want to add any other type files, we need include loader.
1. make sure node version is up to 4.4.1
2. npm install css-loader style-loader
3. recompile 

Step Four
Binding Loaders :
Run : webpack ./entry.js bundle.js --module-bind 'css=style!css'

Step Five 
add config file.

Step Six 
add plugin
