Step One: 
create new file entry.js, index.html
run webpack to build entry.js to bundle.js

Step Two:
add new module content.js, update entry.js to let it depends content.js. 

run webpack to build entry.js and all dependencies into bundle.js

---------
webpack will analyze your entry file for dependencies to other files. These files (called modules) are included in your bundle.js too. webpack will give each module a unique id and save all modules accessible by id in the bundle.js file. Only the entry module is executed on startup. A small runtime provides the require function and executes the dependencies when required.
